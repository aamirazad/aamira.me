I've been pretty exited to use mastodon these past few days but would like to have a local copy of my posts since they still do not have a way to export them. So I'm trying out https://mastofeed.org which should take the rss feed of this new website an send new blog posts to my mastodon profile at https://mastodon.social/@aamira
