If I have have anything important to say to the internet, this is where I'll put it. I don't anything pressing to talk about, but I give some basics about this website. aamirazad.com has served as my main website domain for some years now, and a bunch of my self hosted services on hosted on this site. You can get see the links to them, as well as redirects to project's I've build, and lastly, I have all my contact information in case you need to reach me. This website is built with Nextjs and was adapted from Vercel's portfolio starter kit. Thanks for visiting!
