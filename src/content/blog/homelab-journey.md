# Building My Homelab Journey

When I first started exploring self-hosting, I had no idea it would become such a significant part of my learning journey. What began as a simple curiosity about running my own services has evolved into a comprehensive homelab setup that serves my entire family.

## The Beginning

It all started with an old machine I found on eBay. Nothing fancy - just a reliable box that could run Linux. My goal was simple: learn networking while creating services I actually use every day.

## The Architecture

My current setup runs on a network of computers, from that original eBay find to a Raspberry Pi. The infrastructure now hosts:

-   **Thousands of gigabytes of data**
-   **Multiple intensive services**
-   **High uptime reliability** (check out my [status page](https://status.aamira.me/))

### Key Services

-   **Paperless-ngx** for document management
-   **Immich** for photo storage and organization
-   **Jellyfin** for media streaming
-   **Forgejo** for code repositories
-   **And much more...**

## Security First

One of the things I'm most proud of is achieving **zero open ports** while maintaining full functionality. This wasn't easy, but it taught me invaluable lessons about:

-   Reverse proxies
-   VPN configurations
-   Network segmentation
-   Security best practices

## What I've Learned

Building this homelab has been more educational than any course I could have taken. It's given me hands-on experience with:

1. Linux system administration
2. Network configuration and troubleshooting
3. Container orchestration
4. Backup strategies
5. Security implementation

## Looking Forward

The homelab continues to evolve. Each new service I add teaches me something new, and each problem I solve makes the whole system more robust.

If you're thinking about starting your own homelab journey, my advice is simple: start small, learn as you go, and don't be afraid to break things. That's how you really learn.
