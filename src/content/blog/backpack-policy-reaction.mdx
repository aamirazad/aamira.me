Today, one day before the first day of school, the principle sent <a href="https://papers.aamira.me/share/RaSNLL6bb8jvxJrmrguccnpGp9SXPm84XwZmo8KlxO6j3YP6Al" target="_blank">this document</a>. In it, we are introduced to the new principle, and two new rules that will be put in place this school year. These are the two rules:

- Backpacks will now be placed in student lockers during the school day. No additional bags or purses may be
  carried; however, chromebook cases will be permitted.
- Outside food and drinks are permitted only during the student’s designated lunch period. Clear or transparent
  water bottles are permitted and may only contain regular water. Students who bring other beverages will be asked
  to discard them before entering the school.

In response to this, students discussed the purpose and validity of these rules. In response to the argument that:

> We are the only school in the area that allows backpacks and we are spoiled by it.

I wrote a mini essay about my thoughts of the recent policies schools have created, and the root cause of the issue that seems to be ignored.

Another meaningless argument. I don't mean to be mean but I'm not sure what part of this rule you feel is needed in our school, and why you are so strongly for it. The students at hollidaysburg are really quite tame. You can ask many teachers but the culture here is really nice. We treat the school with respect with the idea that the respect would be mutual. That is what we were promised all those years ago. Ok fine, someone could hide a gun in their backpack, but they could also hide it in their clothing. We really need metal detectors, and at that point, airport security. "Just in case". Obviously, we know what group chat this is so the solution to this is obvious (gun control) but our little school can't fix the entire country. We just have to deal with children getting shot until we stop with the band aids that won't do anything against to the real problem. Either way, the band aid of putting your backpack in your locker will obviously do nothing against someone bringing a gun to school. Like which would you rather, be in a classroom with someone who has a gun in their backpack, or be in a classroom where someone who could go to their locker, get a gun and then walk in your classroom with a gun. Seems the same to me assuming they are going to use it. And the person with a backpack still has it when the entire school is in the cafeteria, in the morning, and when the entire school is in the hallways. The schools are obviously horrible at making informed decisions, and relies on the lazy, scare approach to making rules. Like with the phones, instead of tackling the actual problems of large companies training algorithms to make vulnerable kids whose brains aren’t fully developed yet addicted to their app so they can force ads down their throat and control their life and oh maybe some people will kill themselves as a result but that is just the cost of doing business. Yeah, instead of stopping that, lets make them put their phone up in this little caddy or in a pouch so that after school, they can go right back onto their social media and get all the bad effects of that anyways. These people obviously don’t care about actually solving the problem. They just scare you into thinking their rules are reasonable. Oh, that horrible situation, I could never let my child be in that kind of danger, let’s follow the herd of sheep and all my problems will be gone. Keep letting your superficial solutions give you a false sense of security.
