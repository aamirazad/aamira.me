Building a homelab has been one of the most rewarding learning experiences I've had. In this post, I'll walk you through my journey of creating a secure, reliable, and scalable home infrastructure.

## Why Build a Homelab?

There are several reasons why I decided to build my own homelab:

1. **Learning**: Hands-on experience with enterprise technologies
2. **Self-hosting**: Control over my data and services
3. **Cost savings**: Avoiding monthly subscriptions for basic services
4. **Privacy**: Keeping sensitive data at home

## Hardware Setup

My current setup consists of:

-   **Main Server**: Dell OptiPlex 7040 (Intel i5-6500, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe + 4TB HDD)
-   **Raspberry Pi 4**: For lightweight services and monitoring
-   **Network**: UniFi Dream Machine SE, 24-port managed switch
-   **Storage**: Synology DS220+ for backups

## Software Stack

I'm running everything in containers using Docker and Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
    nginx-proxy-manager:
        image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
        ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
        # ... configuration
```

## Security Considerations

Security is paramount in any homelab setup:

-   **Zero trust network**: No open ports to the internet
-   **VPN access**: WireGuard for remote access
-   **Regular updates**: Automated security patching
-   **Monitoring**: Real-time alerting for anomalies

## Services I'm Running

Currently hosting:

-   File sharing and sync
-   Media streaming (Plex)
-   Home automation (Home Assistant)
-   Password manager (Vaultwarden)
-   Git repositories (Gitea)
-   Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)

## Lessons Learned

Building and maintaining a homelab has taught me:

1. **Documentation is crucial**: Everything should be reproducible
2. **Backups are non-negotiable**: 3-2-1 backup strategy
3. **Start small**: Begin with essential services and expand gradually
4. **Monitor everything**: You can't fix what you can't see

## What's Next?

I'm planning to expand with:

-   Kubernetes cluster for learning container orchestration
-   Additional storage for media collection
-   Better network segmentation with VLANs
-   Automated disaster recovery procedures

Building a homelab is an ongoing journey of learning and improvement. It's not just about the technologyâ€”it's about developing the skills and mindset needed for modern infrastructure management.

If you're thinking about starting your own homelab, my advice is simple: start with what you have and grow from there. The most important step is the first one.
